This repository was created to do the challenges Project 13 of Software Development course at Correlation One.

What this repository will be about is challenging the questions provided by Leetcode, Hackerrank, and/or Codewars to prepare myself for future interviews.

They were tough and I realize I need to spend more time on developing myself into code.

With that in mind, I spent more time on Leetcode compared to the other two. Leetcode and Codewars was definitely simple and easy to navigate. Hackerrank is similar, however, somewhat difficult to navigate.

Out of the three, I would definitely continue my training on Codewars and develop my skills there.

Otherwise, the three questions I've done will all be under Leetcode.
